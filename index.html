  <p> Story: When I visited aurobindo ashram, a decade ago, I was informed of Mother's love for cacti, each cactus had a umbrella like canopy to shade them from the direct sun, I later adopted the Mamalaria cactus, so beloved to my grand master Swami Rama, and to me, except in this experiment for data archiving with vectors, I choose a cactus without thorns!</p>
