  <p> Story: When I visited aurobindo ashram, a decade ago, I was informed of Mother's love for cacti, each cactus had a umbrella like canopy to shade them from the direct sun, I later adopted the Mamalaria cactus, so beloved to my grand master Swami Rama, and to me, except in this experiment for data archiving with vectors, I choose a cactus without thorns!</p>

<h4> Abstract</h4>
<p> Synthetic virology with plant genomic vectors, leads to a homology of data to RNA base pair encodings, which are scalable to exabyte scale storage in non pathogenic replicating viruses, with hosts such as the Mamallaria Microtelle. In this paper we describe techniques for the homotopy, and the algorithms for encapsulating the information RNA wire in viral vector payload. </p>

<p>What:
Plant genomic vectors are used with markers for splicing short sequence RNA strands for non pathogenic replication in a host plant like the  Malaria species, for example maintained by Mother Aurobindo or the Indo-American Hybrid Seeds Farms. This provides viral RNA mapped archiving storage as part of the quantum cloud. Similar to AWS S3 Glacier. Storage densities are very high with a mapping for densities higher than 1 kb/ 100 pairs.</p>

<p>How:
DNA sequences are used for nano-wire based storage by mapping JSON objects mapped to RNA sequences, from an AWS S3 Glacier archive, which has automated archiving from web based databases as unified local/cloud storage using JSON objects.</p>
  
<p>Why:
JS code libraries and frameworks allow for automated generation of code as IaC from JSON data-structures, in an effort to use nldb on a unified NoSQL/file system, we unify Java data structures as Rx programming in Rx++ with a unified JSON/yaml, XML and html DOM structure. Web storage is with AWS S3 integrated with elastic query. The archives are also persisted in quantum genomic storage as RNA strands, in non pathogenic vectors, stored in host plants like the mamalaria.</p>


<p>Applications: Cloud archiving of pentascale and exobyte data.</p>
